At a Summer party, a voice
I came to hear, was from your direction
Always, the voice on the phone
Just talking about mundane things

You are my shyness boy, I've been waiting
Inviting words 
If it's frustrating, I want it just to be for today
I'm falling in love

After a night-time drive
Because it's late, I can't just bid farewell
Today, until the morning, always
Staying together

You are my shyness boy, it's impatient
Your love
Your hand that is holding a cigarette is even shaking
Bad person

You are my shyness boy, I've been waiting
My one complaint
Your eyes are too kind
I like there

You are my shyness boy, I've been waiting
Inviting words
If it's frustrating, I want it just to be for today

You are my shyness boy, I've been waiting
My one complaint
Your eyes are too kind
I like there
