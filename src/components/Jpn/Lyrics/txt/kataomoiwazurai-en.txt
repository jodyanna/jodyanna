Chest is tight, like being in love
Drip drop, the rain is pouring down
Startling, the heart throbbing feeling

Also today, you are moving along, I am standing still
Feeling the distance near and far, even though it should reach you it won't

Hey wait, wait, wait, wait, unrequited love is painful
Love, love, love, love, the thoughts of love are painful
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I want to tell you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you (???)

I love you? I love you? I love you? I love you?
But, like, I can't say that

I'm in love with you

Love, love, love, love, the thoughts of love are painful
Love, love, love, love, jealousy, I'm jealous

I want to eat

Eat it before it gets cold

My pulse and the sound of the rain happen simultaneously 
Drip drop, the rain keeps coming down
Startling, my thumping heartbeat

If the rain finishes up, I want to let you know
I couldn't say, I'm a coward and my feelings...
If they could reach you that'd be nice

Wait, wait, wait, wait, unrequited love is painful
Love, love, love, love, unrequited love is painful
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I want to tell you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you (???)

I wonder will it reach you

Rainy season of love, kicking around the rain clouds, Yamamoto line
Cumulonimbus, love luck, momentum of improvement, yeah Saikyo line
If you think about the weather for tomorrow, it will definitely be sunny
The weather forecast says the design of love is a bursting hurricane of feelings

Look here, human life is non stop, in addition to playing and studying
if a spice is added you'll be in a dream like state. Frantic crying 15Q
I can't be honest every time, cry baby, bye-bye to who I was yesterday
I want to meet right now

Here now, here now, I can see a rainbow, I will go and meet you
It will take a little time, but I'll keep, keep, waiting
