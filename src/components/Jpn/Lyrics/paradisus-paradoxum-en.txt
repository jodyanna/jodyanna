Now let me open the scar
The virus melted together, black shines out from the rainbow

Nectar from a red flower, a wet and hidden noise
From in your chest crawls out, "You want to change your birth, right?"

Forever, a paradigm was resting
A flower was eaten and corroded

Now let me open the scar
The virus melted together, feeling an instinct that becomes exposed
Grew up in the loneliness
A broken reality, black shines out from the rainbow

Break free immediately, sanity's labyrinth
Towards an inverted contrast

On a blue pane of glass, my reflection
With a cruel smile, throat quivers

I'm changing (in)to a monster
Coupled with betrayal, a deeply degenerative process
Is this my insanity?
As long as that question is, it's evidence of my blindness and desire

Jump while in that moment, the world I knew
a paradoxical paradisaical mess

Live it up, up, up! Live it up! Live it up!
Live it up, up, up! Live it up! Live it up!
Live it up, up, up! Live it up! Live it up!
Eyes are opened

Live it up, up, up! Live it up! Live it up!
Live it up, up, up! Live it up! Live it up!
While emotions shake

Now let me open the scar
The virus melted together, with the intention to change my birth
Grew up in the loneliness
Discovered reality, Knew the impurity, more
No longer can return to this bleached paradise
Yes, this is my sanity, embrace the freedom

Break free immediately, sanity's labyrinth
Towards an inverted contrast
Jump, the world I knew
A paradoxical paradisical mess
Reach out, taboo vortex
Black shines, reveal the rainbow
